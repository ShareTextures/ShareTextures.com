<br/><p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p><br/>
<p>A person using CC0 (called the &ldquo;affirmer&rdquo; in the legal code) dedicates a work to the public domain by waiving all of his or her copyright and neighboring and related rights, if any, in a work, to the fullest extent permitted by law. If the waiver isn&rsquo;t effective for any reason, then CC0 acts as a license from the affirmer granting the public an unconditional, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the work for any purpose.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: occasionally a brand name, logo or other copyrighted design may appear in the textures. It is the responsibility of the user not to infringe on these copyrights in their own work.</p>
