    <h1>About us</h1>
    <br/>
<p>We are an architect group who work on architectural visualization and create a lot of texture while doing our jobs.</p>
<br/>
<p>We have thought about that and want to share our personal archives. So here the sharetextures.com</p>
<br/>
<p>Here a few things about our website and working system ;</p>
<br/><br/>
<ul>
    <li>We usually take our own photo shoots for textures. Nikon D90 and 35mm lens used while taking photos. Sometimes we use <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener">CC0</a> licensed photos to create new textures too.</li><br/>
    <li>Most of our archives were created with 4096X4096 pixels texture sets. Such as great for ArchViz.</li><br/>
    <li>We are adding new textures weekly as possible.</li><br/>
    <li>All textures on this site are licensed as <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener">CC0</a>.
