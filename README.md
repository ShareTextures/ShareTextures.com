# Old PHP Website

## Overview

Welcome to the repository for our old PHP generated website, which has not been actively used for the past two years. Despite this, our main website continues to serve high-quality free textures and 3D models through a Node.js and React application. 
Code original owner is https://github.com/gregzaal/ . Thank you for all.

The old PHP code is no longer in active use and is maintained here for archival purposes. Our current website for accessing [free textures](https://www.sharetextures.com/textures/) and 3D models is powered by Node.js and React, offering a modern and efficient way to access our resources.

If you're interested in the old PHP code, you can explore it here, but please note that it is not actively maintained. For current and active features, please visit our website.
